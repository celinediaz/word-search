# word search
 This was one of my assignments of my sys programming class.
It's a C++ app using MFC, it reads the words from the file entrada.txt, just edit the file to change the words.

 FEATURES: 
 - You can select the size of the board
 - The words can be on 8 different directions.
 - Words can intersect each other if they share the same character.
 - You can choose lowercase or uppercase. (The words to be found have their original format though)
 - The words to be found are highlighted with a different color.

PS: This app is definitely not flawless, so make sure that when selecting the size of the board it's big enough to fit your words, and the maximum width and height is around 21.
I probably should've added an exception or at least limited the size that can be chosen, but well, that's what I have. It's not the most detailed program, and it's not very complicated, but it was fun to make.
